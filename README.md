# ADFA-Dataset-Processing
Python script to manipulate large dataset to create dataset for machine learning models. Did optimised file handling to reduce runtime of the module.
Future work to detect type of attack(Hydra-FTP, Hydra-SSH, Adduser, Java-Meterpreter,Meterpreter and Webshell ) using machine learning algorithm
